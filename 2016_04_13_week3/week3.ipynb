    "Suppose you have a particle that is suspended in water and it is moving randomly.  At the start time (time=0), the particle is at the origin (x=0,y=0,z=0).  You can simulate its random walk by dividing time into small timesteps.  In every time step, the particle will move a small distance from where it was in the previous time step. You can use a random number generator to determine how much it moved in a timestep.  You can then add that displacement to its location, to get its location at the new timestep.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, at time=0 our particle is at x=0.  In the next timestep, lets say our random number generator gives us a -.57.  We add the original position and the displacement 0 + -.57 = -.57.  Now we know where it is in that timestep.  Now our random number generator gives us a 1.9.  Then we add the position and the displacement -.57+1.9=1.33.  Now our particle is at x=1.33.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming that at every time step the particle travels a distance along each axis given by a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1, use simulation to determine what probability of particles will have be 10 units of distance away from the origin after 100 time steps.  To determine this probability, you'll need to simulate many particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it might not seem like it, this problem contains many subproblems that are useful for programming in general, so don't think that \"Because I don't want to do simulations of particles professionally, this exercise isn't useful for me.\"  It is. "
