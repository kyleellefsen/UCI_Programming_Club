    "On to our problem!  Suppose we have two DNA sequences, one of which is a mutated version of the other.  Say the original sequence is 'ATTGCGA' and the mutated version is 'ATGGGA'.  If you look carefully, you can determine how many mutations occured between the two sequences.  Mutations include base pair substitutions, insertation, and deletions.  The minimum number of mutations required to turn one sequence into another is called the <em>edit distance</em>.  The question today is: can we write a program that finds the edit distance?  "

Let's call the chunk from the first sequence $\\alpha$ and the chunk from the second $\\beta$.  Assume we already know the edit distance between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.  Let's try to find the edit distance between $\\alpha$ plus one base (called $x$) and $\\beta$ plus one base (called $y$). So we are trying to find the edit distance from $\\alpha x$ to $\\beta y$. \n",
