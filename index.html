                <h2> Welcome to the Spring 2015 UCI Programming Club Website!</h2>
                <div style='text-align:left;'>
                    <p>We are a small group of programmers and soon-to-be programmers at UCI.  Programming, at its core, is problem solving.  Programmers take difficult problems and solve them by transforming them into a language a computer can understand.  Like all problem solving, the answers are easier to find if you pool your knowledge and creativity in a group.  Our programming club is designed so that we can pose problems we are facing in lab to the group, and as a group we can brain storm tools, techniques, and the overall path towards a solution.  If the problem is interesting, we may even write a few lines of code for you.  :)  Our club is made for all members of the UCI neuroscience community; faculty, staff, postdocs, grad students, and undergrads are all welcomed and encouraged to attend.</p>
                    <p>We encourage people who have never programmed before to attend.  We will help you set up a programming environment, point out online resources, and answer any questions you have about programming in general or the specifics of any problem you have to help you get up to speed programming Python.</p>
                    <p>Example topics we have covered/may cover:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text Parsing</li>
                        <li>Opening, modifying, and saving excel spreadsheets</li>
                        <li>Cell Counting</li>
                        <li>Mouse Tracking. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4IcD8Sv5Zg'>Here</a> is a mouse tracker Kyle wrote.  It started as a programming club problem.</li>
                        <li>Spike sorting</li>

                                    <li>We went over the basics of programming, helped everyone set up the programming environment we will be using (<a href='http://continuum.io/downloads'>Anaconda</a>), and discussed several problems we are interested in solving: mouse tracking and analysing RNA seq data. </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Alli is analysing FASTQ RNA-seq data.  In order to practice programming and get a handle on the problems involved, we came up with a simple problem derived from the beginning of the RNA sequence work flow:  now that I have sequenced multiple copies DNA which was synthesized from a strand of RNA, how do I determine which sequences were derived from which RNA strands?
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    In our slightly contrived example, there were 10 original RNA strands, each of different lengths.  We replicated each one 10 times, which gives us a total of 100 sequences.  The problem is, each time we replicated a sequence, there were a few errors.  In this example, all the errors are single replacement mutations (an A got replaced with a G).  Each copy has an unknown number of these point mutations.  Our goal is to use the 100 sequences to recover the original 10 RNA strands.  This isn't exactly the same problem that RNA-seq programs deal with, but many of the issues are the same.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The text file containing the 100 sequences is <a download  target="_blank" href='2015_spring_week2/RNA_sequence.txt'>here</a>.
